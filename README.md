# Huntr

As college students on the verge of entering the professional world, we experienced the shortcomings of conventional job search methods firsthand. These methods often felt impersonal and ineffective at aligning our skills and aspirations with the right job opportunities. Driven by these challenges, we created Huntr—a platform designed to revolutionize the job search experience using advanced algorithms for a personalized and efficient approach.

Huntr is built on a framework that optimizes the job hunting process, making it as intuitive and engaging as using a dating app. Here’s how our platform stands out:

Techniques Used:
-Firebase: Utilized for real-time database management, ensuring that user data is securely managed and seamlessly integrated throughout the platform.
-Python: Powers our backend processes with libraries such as Pandas and Scikit-learn, crucial for parsing job listings and generating personalized job recommendations.
-React: Drives our frontend development, providing a dynamic and responsive user interface.
